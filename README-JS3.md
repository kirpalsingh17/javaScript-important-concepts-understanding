#### What is the difference between let, const and var in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, let, const, and var are all used to declare variables, but they differ in terms of their scope, hoisting behavior, and mutability.

var:

Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning that they are accessible within the function in which they are declared, or globally if they are declared outside of a function.
var variables are also hoisted to the top of their scope, which means that they can be accessed before they are declared.
var variables can be reassigned and their values can be changed.
Example:

javascript
```javascript
function example() {
  var x = 10;
  if (true) {
    var x = 20;
    console.log(x); // Output: 20
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 20
}
example();
```
let:

Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning that they are accessible only within the block in which they are declared (including any nested blocks).
let variables are not hoisted, which means that they cannot be accessed before they are declared.
let variables can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.
Example:

javascript
```javascript
function example() {
  let x = 10;
  if (true) {
    let x = 20;
    console.log(x); // Output: 20
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
}
example();
```
const:

Variables declared with const are also block-scoped, meaning that they are accessible only within the block in which they are declared (including any nested blocks).
const variables are not hoisted, which means that they cannot be accessed before they are declared.
const variables cannot be reassigned or redeclared within the same scope.
Example:

javascript
```javascript

function example() {
  const x = 10;
  if (true) {
    const x = 20;
    console.log(x); // Output: 20
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
}
example();
```


#### What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, there are two ways to define functions: function declarations and function expressions. Although they both create functions, there are some important differences between them.

Function Declaration:
A function declaration is a statement that defines a function with a specified name. It consists of the function keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters (wrapped in parentheses), and the function body (wrapped in curly braces).

Example:

javascript
```javascript

function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```
Function Expression:
A function expression is an expression that defines a function and assigns it to a variable or a property of an object. It consists of the function keyword, followed by an optional name (if you omit the name, it is called an anonymous function), a list of parameters (wrapped in parentheses), and the function body (wrapped in curly braces).

Example:

javascript
```javascript

const add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```
Differences:

Function declarations are hoisted, which means that they are available for use before the execution of the code starts, whereas function expressions are not hoisted.
Function declarations are statements and can be used anywhere a statement can be used, whereas function expressions are used as values and can be used wherever a value can be used (e.g., as arguments to other functions).
Function declarations must have a name, whereas function expressions can be anonymous (i.e., have no name).
Function declarations can be called before they are defined, whereas function expressions can only be called after they are defined.

#### What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes (either global or local) before the code is executed. This means that they are available for use before they are declared.

However, it is important to note that only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments. For example, if a variable is declared and assigned a value later in the code, only the declaration will be hoisted to the top of the scope, not the assignment.

Hoisting occurs in two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase. During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine creates the global object, sets up memory space for variables and functions, and assigns default values to them. In the case of variables, their values are set to undefined.

During the execution phase, the code is executed line by line, and variables are assigned their actual values. Functions, however, are fully hoisted during the creation phase, meaning that they can be called anywhere in the code, even before their declaration.

Here is an example of hoisting in action:

javascript
```javascript
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 10;
```
In this example, even though the variable x is not declared until the second line, it is still available in the first line because its declaration is hoisted to the top of the scope during the creation phase. However, its value is undefined at that point, because the assignment occurs later in the code during the execution phase.

It is generally considered a good practice to declare variables and functions at the beginning of their respective scopes, to avoid any confusion or unexpected behavior due to hoisting.



#### What is the difference between an arrow function and a regular function in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, there are two ways to define functions: regular functions and arrow functions. Although they both create functions, there are some important differences between them.

Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 as a shorthand syntax for creating functions. Here are some of the key differences:

Syntax:
Regular functions use the function keyword followed by the function name, parameter list (wrapped in parentheses), and the function body (wrapped in curly braces).
javascript
```javascript
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```
Arrow functions use an arrow (=>) instead of the function keyword, and the parameter list and function body can be written in different ways depending on the complexity of the function.

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
```
this keyword:
In a regular function, the value of this is determined by how the function is called, which can lead to some confusion or unexpected behavior.
In an arrow function, this is lexically bound, meaning that it is set to the value of this in the surrounding context, which is usually the parent scope. This can make arrow functions easier to reason about and can help prevent some common errors.

arguments object:
In a regular function, the arguments object is an array-like object that contains all of the arguments passed to the function.
In an arrow function, the arguments object is not available, which can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the situation.

Usage:
Regular functions can be used for any type of function, while arrow functions are particularly useful for shorter functions that don't require complex logic or multiple lines of code.
Here's an example of a regular function and an arrow function that do the same thing:

javascript
```javascript
// Regular function
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

// Arrow function
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
```
Ultimately, the choice between regular functions and arrow functions depends on the specific use case and personal preference.



#### What is a generator function in JavaScript?
A generator function is a special type of function in JavaScript that allows you to control the iteration over a sequence of values. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which can be used to generate a series of values on demand, rather than all at once.

Generator functions are defined using the function* syntax (note the asterisk). They use the yield keyword to define the sequence of values to be returned. Each time the yield keyword is encountered, the function returns the current value and "pauses" execution, allowing the calling code to resume the iteration when it's ready.

Here's an example of a simple generator function:

```javascript
function* generateNumbers() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const generator = generateNumbers();

console.log(generator.next()); // Output: { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // Output: { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // Output: { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // Output: { value: undefined, done: true }
```
In this example, the generateNumbers function is defined as a generator function, and it yields the values 1, 2, and 3. The const generator variable is assigned the result of calling the generateNumbers function, which returns a generator object.

Each time the generator.next() method is called, the generator function resumes execution from the point where it left off, and returns the next value in the sequence, along with a done property that indicates whether there are more values to be generated.

Generator functions can also be used to implement infinite sequences or generate values based on external events, making them a powerful tool in JavaScript.




#### How do you use a generator function in JavaScript?

To use a generator function in JavaScript, you first need to define the generator function using the function* syntax. Inside the generator function, you can use the yield keyword to return values one at a time.

Here's an example of a generator function that generates an infinite sequence of random numbers:

```javascript
function* randomNumbers() {
  while (true) {
    yield Math.random();
  }
}
```
In this example, the randomNumbers function is defined as a generator function using the function* syntax. Inside the function, there is a while loop that generates an infinite sequence of random numbers using the Math.random() function and yields each value using the yield keyword.

To use the randomNumbers generator function, you can create an instance of the generator using the function name followed by parentheses, just like calling a regular function. This will return a generator object, which you can use to iterate over the sequence of values using the next() method.

Here's an example of how you could use the randomNumbers generator function to generate five random numbers:

```javascript
const generator = randomNumbers();

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(generator.next().value);
}
```
In this example, the const generator variable is assigned the result of calling the randomNumbers generator function, which returns a generator object.

Inside the for loop, the generator.next() method is called to generate the next value in the sequence. The value property of the result contains the current value of the sequence, and the done property indicates whether there are more values to be generated.

This code will generate five random numbers and output them to the console.

```javascript
0.08127449766676712
0.7160689557201538
0.9663585278550099
0.350323771249771
0.6567341319190859
```


#### What is the difference between call, apply and bind in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, call, apply, and bind are methods that allow you to set the this value and pass arguments to a function.

The main differences between them are:

call and apply are used to invoke a function immediately, while bind returns a new function with the this value and arguments bound.
call and apply take the this value as the first argument, while bind takes the this value as the first argument and allows you to pass additional arguments.
apply takes an array of arguments, while call takes a list of arguments.
Here's an example of how to use call, apply, and bind:

```javascript
const obj = { name: 'Alice' };

function sayHello(message, punctuation) {
  console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}${punctuation}`);
}

// Using call:
sayHello.call(obj, 'Hello', '!'); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"

// Using apply:
sayHello.apply(obj, ['Hi', '?']); // Output: "Hi, Alice?"

// Using bind:
const boundSayHello = sayHello.bind(obj, 'Hey');
boundSayHello('!!!'); // Output: "Hey, Alice!!!"
```
In this example, the sayHello function is defined with two arguments: message and punctuation. Inside the function, it uses this.name to access the name property of the object passed as this.

To call the sayHello function with a specific this value and set arguments, you can use call or apply. call takes the this value as the first argument, followed by the arguments to the function. apply takes the this value as the first argument and an array of arguments to the function.

To create a new function with a bound this value and arguments, you can use bind. bind takes the this value as the first argument, followed by the arguments to the function. It returns a new function with the this value and arguments bound, which can be called later.

In this example, the sayHello function is called three times using call, apply, and bind, respectively, with different arguments. The this value is set to the obj object, which has a name property of 'Alice'. The output shows the result of calling the function with the specified arguments and this value.



#### How do you use call, apply and bind in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, call, apply, and bind are methods that allow you to set the this value and pass arguments to a function.

Here's an example of how to use call, apply, and bind:

```javascript
const obj = { name: 'Alice' };

function sayHello(message, punctuation) {
  console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}${punctuation}`);
}

// Using call:
sayHello.call(obj, 'Hello', '!'); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"

// Using apply:
sayHello.apply(obj, ['Hi', '?']); // Output: "Hi, Alice?"

// Using bind:
const boundSayHello = sayHello.bind(obj, 'Hey');
boundSayHello('!!!'); // Output: "Hey, Alice!!!"
```
In this example, the sayHello function is defined with two arguments: message and punctuation. Inside the function, it uses this.name to access the name property of the object passed as this.

To call the sayHello function with a specific this value and set arguments, you can use call or apply. call takes the this value as the first argument, followed by the arguments to the function. apply takes the this value as the first argument and an array of arguments to the function.

To create a new function with a bound this value and arguments, you can use bind. bind takes the this value as the first argument, followed by the arguments to the function. It returns a new function with the this value and arguments bound, which can be called later.

In this example, the sayHello function is called three times using call, apply, and bind, respectively, with different arguments. The this value is set to the obj object, which has a name property of 'Alice'. The output shows the result of calling the function with the specified arguments and this value.



#### What is a higher-order function in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, a higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. This means that higher-order functions can operate on functions themselves, treating them like any other type of data.

Higher-order functions can be used to create more abstract and reusable code, by separating concerns and allowing functions to be composed together in different ways.

For example, consider the map method on arrays, which takes a function as an argument and applies it to each element of the array, returning a new array with the results:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const squared = numbers.map(function(num) {
  return num * num;
});

console.log(squared); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```
In this example, the map method is a higher-order function because it takes a function as an argument (in this case, an anonymous function that squares each element of the array). The function is then called for each element of the array, and the results are collected into a new array.

Another example of a higher-order function in JavaScript is setTimeout, which takes a function as its first argument and a number of milliseconds as its second argument. The function is called after the specified delay:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

setTimeout(sayHello, 1000); // Output: "Hello!" (after 1 second)
```
In this example, setTimeout is a higher-order function because it takes a function as its first argument (in this case, the sayHello function). The function is then called after the specified delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

Higher-order functions are a powerful feature of JavaScript and can be used to create more expressive and flexible code.



#### How do you use a higher-order function in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, you can use a higher-order function by passing one or more functions as arguments to another function, or by returning a function from a function. Here are a few examples:

Passing a function as an argument:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function applyOperation(a, b, operation) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

console.log(applyOperation(2, 3, add));       // Output: 5
console.log(applyOperation(2, 3, multiply));  // Output: 6
```
In this example, applyOperation is a higher-order function that takes two numbers and a function as arguments. It then applies the function to the numbers and returns the result. The add and multiply functions are passed as arguments to applyOperation, which then calls them with the numbers 2 and 3, respectively.

Returning a function from a function:

```javascript
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function(number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5));   // Output: 10
console.log(triple(5));   // Output: 15
```
In this example, multiplyBy is a higher-order function that takes a number factor and returns a new function that takes another number number and multiplies it by factor. The returned function is a closure that remembers the value of factor. The double and triple functions are created by calling multiplyBy with 2 and 3, respectively. They can then be called with a number to return the result of multiplying the number by 2 or 3.

These are just a few examples of how to use higher-order functions in JavaScript. Higher-order functions are a powerful feature that can make your code more expressive and flexible, and allow you to create more reusable and composable code.



#### What is the difference between map, filter and reduce in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, map, filter, and reduce are three commonly used array methods that are used to perform different kinds of operations on arrays.

map: The map method creates a new array by calling a function on each element of an existing array, and using the returned value as the corresponding element of the new array. The original array is not modified.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const squared = numbers.map(function(num) {
  return num * num;
});

console.log(squared); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```
In this example, the map method is used to create a new array called squared which contains the squares of each element of the original numbers array.

filter: The filter method creates a new array by filtering the elements of an existing array based on a condition specified in a function. Only elements that satisfy the condition are included in the new array. The original array is not modified.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const even = numbers.filter(function(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(even); // Output: [2, 4]
```

In this example, the filter method is used to create a new array called even which contains only the even numbers from the original numbers array.

reduce: The reduce method reduces an array to a single value by repeatedly calling a function on each element of the array and accumulating the result. The function takes two arguments: an accumulator and the current element of the array. The accumulator is updated on each iteration and its final value is returned as the result of the reduce method.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const sum = numbers.reduce(function(accumulator, num) {
  return accumulator + num;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 10
```
In this example, the reduce method is used to calculate the sum of all the elements of the numbers array.

In summary, the main difference between map, filter, and reduce is the type of operation they perform on an array. map is used to transform each element of an array into a new value, filter is used to select elements from an array based on a condition, and reduce is used to reduce an array to a single value by applying a function to each element.



#### How do you use map, filter and reduce in JavaScript?

Here are some examples of how to use map, filter, and reduce in JavaScript:

map: To use the map method, you call it on an array and pass in a function as an argument. This function takes the current element of the array as its argument, and should return a new value for that element. The map method returns a new array with the transformed values.
Example: Transform an array of numbers by doubling each element.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const doubled = numbers.map(function(num) {
  return num * 2;
});

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```
filter: To use the filter method, you call it on an array and pass in a function as an argument. This function should return true or false depending on whether the current element should be included in the new array. The filter method returns a new array with only the elements that returned true.
Example: Filter an array of numbers to only include even numbers.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const even = numbers.filter(function(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(even); // Output: [2, 4]
```
reduce: To use the reduce method, you call it on an array and pass in a function as an argument. This function takes two arguments: an accumulator and the current element of the array. The function should return the updated value of the accumulator. The reduce method returns the final value of the accumulator.
Example: Calculate the sum of an array of numbers.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const sum = numbers.reduce(function(accumulator, num) {
  return accumulator + num;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 10
```
In this example, the reduce method is called on the numbers array, and the function passed in takes two arguments: an accumulator (initialized as 0), and the current element of the array. On each iteration, the current element is added to the accumulator, and the updated accumulator value is returned. At the end, the final value of the accumulator (which is the sum of all the numbers) is returned.



#### What is a curried function in JavaScript?

A curried function in JavaScript is a function that takes multiple arguments one at a time instead of taking all of its arguments at once. It works by returning a new function that takes the next argument, and so on until all the arguments have been received and the final result can be returned.

Here's an example of a curried function:

```javascript
function multiply(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a * b;
  }
}

const double = multiply(2); // returns a new function that multiplies by 2

console.log(double(3)); // Output: 6
```
In this example, multiply is a curried function that takes one argument (a) and returns a new function that takes another argument (b). The new function multiplies a and b together and returns the result.

The double constant is created by calling multiply with the argument 2. This returns a new function that multiplies its argument by 2, which is assigned to the double constant.

Finally, double is called with the argument 3, which results in the value 6 being returned.

Currying can be useful for creating more flexible and reusable functions, as well as for simplifying code and reducing repetition. It allows you to create functions that are more composable and easier to understand.



#### How do you use a curried function in JavaScript?

Here's an example of how to use a curried function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function add(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const addFive = add(5); // returns a new function that adds 5 to its argument

console.log(addFive(3)); // Output: 8
```
In this example, the add function is a curried function that takes one argument (a) and returns a new function that takes another argument (b). The new function adds a and b together and returns the result.

The addFive constant is created by calling add with the argument 5. This returns a new function that adds its argument to 5, which is assigned to the addFive constant.

Finally, addFive is called with the argument 3, which results in the value 8 being returned.

This example demonstrates the power of currying for creating more flexible and reusable functions. By creating a function that can be partially applied with arguments, you can create more specialized versions of that function that can be used in a variety of situations.



#### What is a closure in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, a closure is created whenever a function is defined inside another function. The inner function has access to variables in the outer function's scope, even after the outer function has returned. This allows the inner function to "remember" the state of the outer function's variables at the time it was created.

Here's an example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  const message = 'Hello';

  function inner() {
    console.log(message);
  }

  return inner;
}

const fn = outer();
fn(); // Output: 'Hello'
```
In this example, outer is a function that defines a local variable message and a nested function inner. inner has access to message even after outer has returned. When outer is called, it returns inner, which is assigned to the fn constant. When fn is called, it logs the value of message to the console.

Closures are powerful because they allow functions to access variables from their parent scope, even if those variables are no longer in scope. This can be useful for creating private variables or functions that can only be accessed by certain code. Closures are also used extensively in functional programming, where they allow functions to be composed together in powerful ways.



#### How do you use closures in JavaScript?

Here's an example of how to use closures in JavaScript:

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
}

const counter = makeCounter();
counter(); // Output: 1
counter(); // Output: 2
counter(); // Output: 3
```
In this example, makeCounter is a function that returns another function. The returned function increments a local variable count each time it is called and logs its value to the console.

When makeCounter is called, it creates a new closure containing the local variable count and the returned function. This closure "remembers" the state of count each time the returned function is called, allowing it to keep track of how many times it has been called.

The counter constant is assigned the returned function from makeCounter. When counter is called, it increments count and logs its value to the console. Each time counter is called, it has access to the closure created by makeCounter, allowing it to access and modify the value of count.

This example demonstrates the power of closures for creating functions that "remember" state and can be used in a variety of situations. By creating a closure with local variables, you can create functions that have private data and can only be accessed in certain ways.



#### What is memoization in JavaScript?

Memoization is a technique used in computer science and programming to speed up the execution of functions by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

In JavaScript, memoization can be implemented using closures. Here's an example:

```javascript
function memoize(func) {
  const cache = {};

  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key]) {
      console.log('Returning cached result');
      return cache[key];
    }

    console.log('Calculating result');
    const result = func.apply(null, args);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  }
}

function fib(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }

  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}

const memoizedFib = memoize(fib);

console.log(memoizedFib(10)); // Output: 55 (calculated)
console.log(memoizedFib(10)); // Output: 55 (cached)
```
In this example, memoize is a higher-order function that takes a function func as an argument and returns a new function that memoizes its results. The memoized function uses a cache object to store the results of expensive function calls.

The fib function is a recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. When memoizedFib is called with the same input multiple times, the result is cached and returned from the cache on subsequent calls.

This example demonstrates how memoization can be used to optimize the performance of functions that are called frequently with the same input. By caching the results of expensive function calls, you can avoid redundant computation and speed up your code.



#### How do you use memoization in JavaScript?

To use memoization in JavaScript, you can create a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that memoizes its results. Here's an example:

```javascript
function memoize(func) {
  const cache = {};

  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key]) {
      console.log('Returning cached result');
      return cache[key];
    }

    console.log('Calculating result');
    const result = func.apply(null, args);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  }
}

function add(x, y) {
  console.log('Calculating sum');
  return x + y;
}

const memoizedAdd = memoize(add);

console.log(memoizedAdd(2, 3)); // Output: Calculating sum, 5
console.log(memoizedAdd(2, 3)); // Output: Returning cached result, 5
console.log(memoizedAdd(4, 5)); // Output: Calculating sum, 9
console.log(memoizedAdd(4, 5)); // Output: Returning cached result, 9
```
In this example, memoize is a higher-order function that takes a function func as an argument and returns a new function that memoizes its results. The memoized function uses a cache object to store the results of expensive function calls.

The add function is a simple function that adds two numbers together. When memoizedAdd is called with the same input multiple times, the result is cached and returned from the cache on subsequent calls.

This example demonstrates how memoization can be used to optimize the performance of functions that are called frequently with the same input. By caching the results of expensive function calls, you can avoid redundant computation and speed up your code.



#### What is a decorator function in JavaScript?

A decorator function in JavaScript is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function with added functionality. The decorator function wraps the original function, adding new behavior to it, without modifying its source code.

Here's an example of a decorator function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function logDecorator(func) {
  return function() {
    console.log('Starting function');
    const result = func.apply(null, arguments);
    console.log('Ending function');
    return result;
  }
}

function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

const decoratedAdd = logDecorator(add);

console.log(decoratedAdd(2, 3)); // Output: Starting function, Ending function, 5
```
In this example, logDecorator is a decorator function that takes a function func as an argument and returns a new function that logs the start and end of the function. The new function calls the original func function with the same arguments and returns its result.

The add function is a simple function that adds two numbers together. When decoratedAdd is called, it logs the start and end of the function, then calls the original add function with the same arguments and returns its result.

This example demonstrates how a decorator function can be used to add new behavior to an existing function without modifying its source code. By wrapping the original function with a decorator function, you can reuse the original function with added functionality, making it more versatile and easier to maintain.



#### How do you use a decorator function in JavaScript?

To use a decorator function in JavaScript, you can create a decorator function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function with added functionality. Here's an example:

```javascript
function logDecorator(func) {
  return function() {
    console.log('Starting function');
    const result = func.apply(null, arguments);
    console.log('Ending function');
    return result;
  }
}

function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

const decoratedAdd = logDecorator(add);

console.log(decoratedAdd(2, 3)); // Output: Starting function, Ending function, 5
```
In this example, logDecorator is a decorator function that takes a function func as an argument and returns a new function that logs the start and end of the function. The new function calls the original func function with the same arguments and returns its result.

The add function is a simple function that adds two numbers together. When decoratedAdd is called, it logs the start and end of the function, then calls the original add function with the same arguments and returns its result.
